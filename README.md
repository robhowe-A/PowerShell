PowerShell is used for many application interactions for administration and Windows functions.  

Navigate the folders for folder-specific information.  

## 9-14-2024 Update  
— All files in this repository have been developed by Robert Howell  
— Any of the code can be used or built upon in your projects, too. Again, I created all of them and developed the code based on my experiences. Any file missing a description header just had not been updated, and one should be included when used in production environments
