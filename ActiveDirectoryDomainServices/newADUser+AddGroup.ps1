#Title: newADUser+AddGroup.ps1
Author: Robert Howell
Description: This script is example code demonstrating the creation of active directory
    users in bulk. It can be used when multiple accounts are needed created having similar attributes.
    A For loop cycles the variable's values, creating unique user IDs sharing the same attributes. Single accounts
    needing different attribute values are unaccounted for and need to be entered manually.
        
Parameters: 
-This script adds the "DeveloperPortal" group permission to the account membership.

Instructions:
1. Confirm variables.
    -The number of users and user attributes can be modified
2. Begin the script. You will be prompted to enter a password, which will be the account's password from start.
3. Monitor the output for progress and/or errors.

Note:
- Account numbers are added to the account name upon creation.
    EX: First Name = sp, Last Name = user
        RESULT: spuser1
                spuser2
                ...
                spuser<n>
- All passwords start as the same, so the accounts are disabled. It is expected each user to create
    a new password when the account is activated.
- AD information is populated such as: city, dept, division, and title
